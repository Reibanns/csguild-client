# Spec-Driven Development Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for implementing the spec-driven development workflow. The spec-driven approach ensures systematic analysis, planning, and implementation of every feature request.

**SPEC MODE: Activated.**

## Core Principles

### 1. Systematic Analysis First
Every feature request must go through three mandatory phases:
1. **Spec Phase**: High-level analysis and conceptual design
2. **Requirements Phase**: Detailed functional and technical requirements
3. **Tasks Phase**: Implementation-ready task breakdown

### 2. Quality Gate Enforcement
Each phase must meet quality standards before progressing:
- Spec completeness validation
- Requirements coverage assessment
- Task feasibility verification

### 3. Traceability
All decisions and requirements must be traceable:
- Business objectives to requirements
- Requirements to implementation tasks
- Implementation to testing and validation

## Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Spec Creation

#### When to Create a Spec
- New feature requests
- Major enhancements
- System integrations
- Architecture changes

#### Spec Creation Steps
1. **Context Analysis**
   - Understand business context
   - Identify stakeholders
   - Assess technical feasibility
   - Determine scope and complexity

2. **Problem Definition**
   - Clear problem statement
   - Success criteria definition
   - Constraints identification
   - Assumptions documentation

3. **Solution Concept**
   - High-level solution approach
   - Technology considerations
   - Architecture impact assessment
   - Risk identification

4. **Acceptance Criteria**
   - Measurable success criteria
   - Quality requirements
   - Performance benchmarks

### Phase 2: Requirements Development

#### Requirements Types
- **Functional Requirements**: What the system must do
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Quality attributes
- **Technical Requirements**: Implementation specifications
- **Business Requirements**: Business rules and workflows

#### Requirements Quality Standards
- **Completeness**: All aspects covered
- **Consistency**: No conflicting requirements
- **Testability**: Each requirement verifiable
- **Traceability**: Clear business justification

### Phase 3: Task Breakdown

#### Task Granularity
- Tasks should be 2-8 hours of work
- Clear deliverables and acceptance criteria
- Minimal dependencies between tasks
- Realistic time estimates

#### Task Categories
- **Backend Development**: API, database, business logic
- **Frontend Development**: UI components, user interactions
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, end-to-end tests
- **Documentation**: API docs, user guides
- **Quality Assurance**: Code review, security audit
- **Deployment**: Environment setup, monitoring

## File Organization

### Directory Structure
```
.spec/
├── <feature-name>/
│   ├── spec.md              # High-level specification
│   ├── requirements.md      # Detailed requirements
│   └── tasks.md             # Implementation tasks
├── templates/
│   ├── spec-template.md
│   ├── requirements-template.md
│   └── tasks-template.md
└── guidelines.md            # This file
```

### Naming Conventions
- Feature folders: `kebab-case` (e.g., `user-authentication`, `payment-processing`)
- Files: Always use exact names `spec.md`, `requirements.md`, `tasks.md`
- Templates: Prefixed with template type (e.g., `spec-template.md`)

## Quality Standards

### Spec Quality Checklist
- [ ] Problem statement is clear and unambiguous
- [ ] Solution approach is technically feasible
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are measurable
- [ ] Risks are identified with mitigation strategies
- [ ] Stakeholders are identified and engaged
- [ ] Success metrics are defined

### Requirements Quality Checklist
- [ ] All functional requirements documented
- [ ] Non-functional requirements specified
- [ ] Technical constraints identified
- [ ] Dependencies clearly stated
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined for each requirement

### Tasks Quality Checklist
- [ ] Tasks are appropriately sized (2-8 hours)
- [ ] Dependencies are clearly identified
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific and measurable
- [ ] Estimates are realistic and include buffer time
- [ ] Tasks follow the INVEST principle (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)

## Automation Features

### Automatic Activation
- **SPEC MODE: Activated.** displayed for every feature request
- Automatic folder creation in `.spec/<feature-name>/`
- Template file generation from predefined templates

### Validation Checks
- Syntax validation of markdown files
- Completeness checks for required sections
- Cross-reference validation between spec files
- Dependency analysis and conflict detection

### Progress Tracking
- Phase completion status monitoring
- Automatic todo list generation from tasks.md
- Implementation progress tracking
- Quality gate enforcement

## Exception Handling

### Complex Features
For features requiring extensive analysis:
- Extended spec phase with stakeholder interviews
- Technical spike tasks for feasibility validation
- Prototype development before full implementation
- Iterative refinement of specifications

### Urgent Requests
For critical/urgent features:
- Expedited spec review process (24-48 hours)
- Parallel requirements development
- Prioritized task execution
- Compressed timeline with mandatory quality checkpoints

### Blocked Features
When dependencies cannot be resolved:
- Dependency analysis and impact assessment
- Alternative implementation strategies
- Risk mitigation planning
- Contingency task development

## Integration Points

### Development Tools
- **IDE Integration**: Automatic file creation and validation
- **Version Control**: Spec files committed with feature branches
- **Project Management**: Task synchronization with project boards
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated validation of spec compliance

### Communication
- **Stakeholder Reviews**: Regular check-ins for spec validation
- **Team Alignment**: Cross-functional review meetings
- **Documentation**: Centralized knowledge base for specifications
- **Feedback Loops**: Post-implementation reviews and improvements

## Continuous Improvement

### Metrics Tracking
- Spec completion time
- Requirements stability
- Task estimation accuracy
- Implementation defect rates
- Feature delivery time

### Process Refinement
- Regular retrospectives on spec quality
- Template updates based on lessons learned
- Process documentation improvements
- Tool and automation enhancements

### Training and Adoption
- Team training on spec-driven processes
- Mentoring for new team members
- Best practice sharing sessions
- Process compliance monitoring

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Specs
1. **Be Specific**: Use concrete examples and measurable criteria
2. **Consider Edge Cases**: Document exceptional scenarios
3. **Validate Assumptions**: Test key assumptions early
4. **Engage Stakeholders**: Regular feedback and validation
5. **Keep it Current**: Update specs as understanding evolves

### Managing Requirements
1. **Prioritize Ruthlessly**: Focus on high-value requirements first
2. **Maintain Traceability**: Link requirements to business value
3. **Validate Continuously**: Regular requirement validation
4. **Manage Scope Creep**: Clear change control process
5. **Document Rationale**: Explain why requirements exist

### Breaking Down Tasks
1. **Think Small**: Tasks should be completable in one sitting
2. **Define Done**: Clear acceptance criteria for each task
3. **Consider Dependencies**: Identify and manage task relationships
4. **Include Testing**: Every task includes testing requirements
5. **Estimate Realistically**: Include time for unexpected issues

**Remember**: Quality implementation starts with quality specifications. The spec-driven approach ensures that every feature is thoroughly analyzed, clearly defined, and properly planned before implementation begins.

**SPEC MODE: Always active for feature requests.**
